            {`   1. Identify variables and make sure you note EXACTLY what they represent. There can be tricks in their definitions, like "x is the number of years after 2000". This means that if the year is 2000, then x = 0.

    2. Create equations sentence by sentence as you go through the question. Be very careful to create equations that match what is being said, and it can help to plug in real numbers for the variables to make sure your equations make sense. The purpose of creating equations is to eventually solve for one variable like in a systems of equations. Whenever you can, try to solve for one variable in terms of another.

    3. Ensure that you answer the question that's being asked and not something you solved for earlier. Boxing the question you care about and looking at it again before you move on can help prevent you from making mistakes.`}

            {`  The first sentence, "A manufacturer shipped units of a certain product to two locations." doesn't really matter.
            
    The second sentence, "The equation above shows the total shipping cost T, in dollars, for shipping c units to the closer location and shipping f units to the farther location." is full of information.
    It clarifies the variables and I would recommend writing to the side "c = number of units shipped to closer location," "f = number of units shipped to farther away location," and "T = total shipping cost, in dollars."
    The fact that there are two variables means that this is probably a "systems of equations" question, which is something you should be very familiar with for this test.
            
    The third sentence, "If the total shipping cost was $47,000 and 3,000 units were shipped to the farther location, how many units were shipped to the closer location." is extremely full of information and should be tackled one piece at a time.
    Starting at the beginning, "the total shipping cost was $47,000" is an equation. The total EQUALS $47,000 and we know that our variable T = total shipping cost, in dollars. Thus we can plug in $47,000 in for T to get the new equation:`}
