            {`   1. A semicolon ( ; ) separates two independent clauses. Independent clauses are complete sentences, and they can stand alone as a sentence. The other punctuation marks used to separate two independent clauses are periods and a comma paired with an appropriate coordinating conjuction (FANBOYS - for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so).
    
    Because these all perform the same function, they should be considered to be exactly the same on this test. Meaning that if I had the following answer choices on my test,
    
    A. lied. Then
    B. lied; then
    C. lied then
    D. lied, then
    
    Answer choice C or D would have to be the correct answer because A and B are using punctuation that does the same thing, and there can't be multiple correct answers, so they must both be wrong.
    On this test you will frequently see answer choices that are exactly the same except they will replace a period with a semicolon or a comma with an appropriate FANBOYS. Don't be fooled! Both answers choices must be wrong because a period and a semicolon do exactly the same thing.

    2. A colon ( : ) is used after an independent clause and before a direct example or explanation of what the previous sentence was discussing. A colon can be used before a list, but it can also be used before an independent clause or a single word. An easy way to determine if a colon is being used incorrectly is to determine if what came before it was an independent clause or not.

    Correct -   If I could have one wish come true, I would only want one thing: a new car.
    Correct -   I have three pets: Max, Dilby, and Cinnamon.
    Correct -   I only agree with one theory of relativity: Einstein's theory of relativity which states all matter is made of energy.
    Incorrect - I love only certain types of pizza, including: pepperoni, mushroom, and olive.
    
    "I love to eat many different types of pizza, including" came before the colon, and because it is not an independent clause, the colon is being used incorrectly. Words like "including", "such as", "like", and "for example" usually don't belong before a colon because saying them at the end of a sentence would make the sentence no longer be independent.

            {`  The first sentence, "A manufacturer shipped units of a certain product to two locations." doesn't really matter.
            
    The second sentence, "The equation above shows the total shipping cost T, in dollars, for shipping c units to the closer location and shipping f units to the farther location." is full of information.
    It clarifies the variables and I would recommend writing to the side "c = number of units shipped to closer location," "f = number of units shipped to farther away location," and "T = total shipping cost, in dollars."
    The fact that there are two variables means that this is probably a "systems of equations" question, which is something you should be very familiar with for this test.
            
    The third sentence, "If the total shipping cost was $47,000 and 3,000 units were shipped to the farther location, how many units were shipped to the closer location." is extremely full of information and should be tackled one piece at a time.
    Starting at the beginning, "the total shipping cost was $47,000" is an equation. The total EQUALS $47,000 and we know that our variable T = total shipping cost, in dollars. Thus we can plug in $47,000 in for T to get the new equation:`}
